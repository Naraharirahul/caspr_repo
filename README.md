This is a github repository containing all the files required to simulate a Lidar to move in the same velocity as that of a cable robot in CASPR simulation.

Following steps needs to be performed to make the lidar follow the trajectory of the cable robot.

Step 1: 
git clone this repository into a local catkin workspace. 

Step 2: 
In your Ubuntu system install MATLAB and then change the path in Matlab to the CASPR folder in the repo you have just cloned. Start CASPR by running the initialise_CASPR.m file in MATLAB.
